It is a piece on the personal journey of the artist, the creative process and the landscape itself. Alone on the most featureless landscape on earth, Murray's personal video diary captures the beauty of this bleak, empty and desolate environment - and provides the catalyst for an unexpected personal transformation. Told with subtlety, care and gentle dry humor, SALT is the story of what emanates from emptiness. By combining the breathtaking imagery of this surreal landscape with the hauntingly delicate sounds of Aajinta's \"Harmonic Sphere's, it attempts to identify what lies beneath the surface of our reality and how 'something' can be produced from 'nothing'.
