A group of men lands in a balloon on an area (it's not a planet, it's more like a hill) where talking apes rule and humans are slaves. The apes try to transform the guys in monkeys; a simian princess falls in love with one of them; and so on. This film is one of the several movies made for the popular Brazilian group \"Os Trapalhões\" - Didi (Renato Aragão), Dedé, Mussum and Zacarias (who at this point hadn't joined the troupe yet) -, many of them inspired by American blockbusters. It's a very fun entertainment, but the humor is very \"local\" to be understood in other countries. Oh, yeah, the ape \"makeup\" is terrible, but that's part of the fun.
